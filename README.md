# The-Table-Cell-Recognition-TCR-
The Table Cell Recognition (TCR) dataset is designed to address the limitations of existing table structure recognition datasets, specifically by providing fine-grained cell-scale annotations that include table footersâ€”a component often overlooked in prior work. This section details the data acquisition, annotation process, quality assurance mechanisms, and distribution of the dataset, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of its construction and utility in enhancing table recognition models.
